# Bio

Avatar

I currently live in Manchester, UK and work at Total Processing. I'm a DevOps engineering and previously studied at Bristol's UWE.

Email: [harryhughes13@gmail.com](harryhughes13@gmail.com)

My experience lies in DevOps engineering. Cloud Engineering (Azure + AWS), Systems Administration & Engineering, Support and Automation. I thoroughly enjoy designing, building, managing, maintaing and monitoring cloud _(and my own bare metal, raspberry pis!)_ infrastructure. I am a constant learner, problem solver and hard worker who loves contributing a cause far greater than my own. Off my computer you'll tend to find me out with friends, enjoying music events and hiking/cycling.
