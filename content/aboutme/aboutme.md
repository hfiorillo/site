# About Me

I currently live in Manchester, UK, and I work as a DevOps Engineer at Total Processing (a fintech company), though I often end up wearing many hats. My current tech stack revolves around GCP, Kubernetes, and Golang. I use a wide variety of tools to complement those core products and tend to be fairly agnostic when it comes to tooling, programming languages, or public cloud preferences.

My humble beginnings do not lie in tech; I actually have a degree in Economics! I didn’t even make it to the end of my degree before realizing the world of Economics wasn’t for me. After being increasingly drawn to my friends studying computer science, I began teaching myself about the world of tech.

Most of my experience lies within DevOps and Platform Engineering. Recently, my work has focused on Platform Engineering — building internal tools and improving DevEx for our developers. While I’ve been building tools to automate tasks throughout my career, there’s a clear distinction between tools I’ve built on a whim to fix issues at a point in time (i.e., a simple log-sink monitoring alert system) versus solving an underlying problem for a team through a fully-fledged application. I thoroughly enjoy doing both!

## Professional Experience

**Total Processing - DevOps Engineer (Sept. 2022 - Present)**
- In-house DevOps Engineer embedded in a small team of developers.
- Strong philosophy around the idea of 'shifting left' and moving towards trunk based development for our software engineers.
- End-to-end deployment and management of kubernetes clusters and the production services on them using Argo, IAC (Golang + Pulumi) and a whole host of cutting edge tools.
- Worked across the full stack when building applications with a focus on backend work and mainly using Golang.
- Key projects worked on:
  - Created automatically generated Preview Environments for features on backend and frontend applications when a new feature request opened (Crossplane, ArgoWorkflows/ArgoCD, cdk8s)
  - Setup and built our CICD runners and testing pipelines in Gitlab
  - Creating a SecretOps platform (HTMX, Golang, GCPSM)
  - Backstage for documentation
  - Log sink monitoring solution with alerts into slack channels
  - Migrated our local development environments from docker compose to Tilt (Kubernetes)

**Naimuri - DevSecOps/Platform Engineer (Sept. 2021 - Sept. 2022)**
- Consulted out as a DevSecOps and Platform Engineer to government projects as well as maintain in-house kube clusters, create automation tools and kubernetes (AWS)
- Key projects worked on:
