# About Me

I currently live in Manchester, UK and I work as officially as a DevOps Engineer at Total Processing (a fintech company) but often end up wearing many hats.

My humble beginnings do not lie in tech and I instead have a degree in Economics! I didn't even make it to the end of my degree before realising it wasn't for me and swiftly began teaching my self about the world of tech.

My work experience lies mostly within DevOps and Platform Engineering. Most recently my work has centered around Platform Engineering, that is building internal tools and improving DevEx for our developers. Whilst i've been building tools to automate things my whole career, there is a clear distinction between the tools i've built on a whim to fix some problems at a point in time (i.e. a simple log-sink monitoring alert system) vs solving an underlying problem for a team through a fully fledged application. I throughly enjoy doing both!
