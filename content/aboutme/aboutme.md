# About Me

I work as a DevOps Engineer at Total Processing (a fintech company) where i've worked on a whole host of different projects (see my professional experience below for more info). My humble beginnings do not lie in tech; I actually have a degree in Economics! Fortunately for me, I was more interested in the Economicmetrics, data science and programming side of my degree.

Most of my professional experience lies within DevOps and Platform Engineering. More recently, work has been focused more around Platform Engineering â€” namely, building internal tools and improving DevEx for our developers.
